# Coffee-Shop

## RS School Final Task – eCommerce Application

For the final task of the JS Frontend Course 2024-25, our team decided to implement a Coffee Shop that sells different kinds of caffeinated drinks to customers. The idea behind the project is to use CommerceTools to serve as the backend for handling the eCommerce platform and create a client API to communicate with the backend. But the main focus is to develop a user-friendly and working frontend.

This project is a team effort of three developers to create a mock website for coffee products to sell to customers.

## Key Pages

Our application includes:

- Login and Registration pages 🖥️
- Main page 🏠
- Catalog of Coffees page 📋
- Detailed Coffee page 🔎
- User Profile page 👤
- Basket page 🛒
- About Us page 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️
